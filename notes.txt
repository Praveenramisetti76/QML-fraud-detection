Purpose:

Detects fraudulent credit card transactions
Helps prevent customers from being charged for unauthorized purchases
Uses both quantum and classical machine learning approaches for comparison
Data Handling:

Uses a dataset from Kaggle containing credit card transactions
The data includes legitimate and fraudulent transactions
Highly imbalanced dataset: only 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent
Features are already preprocessed using PCA (V1 to V28) to protect user privacy
Data Preprocessing:

Balances the dataset using undersampling technique
Scales features to [0,1] range using MinMaxScaler
Performs zero-padding to make features compatible with quantum circuits
Splits data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets
Quantum Model Implementation:

Uses Qiskit for quantum machine learning
Components:
Feature Map (FM): Converts classical data to quantum states using amplitude encoding
Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC): Creates the quantum circuit for learning
Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC): Combines FM and PQC for classification
Uses quantum simulator for training


Classical Models Comparison: Implements several classical machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Model Evaluation:

Uses multiple metrics:
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC AUC score
Important because of the imbalanced nature of fraud detection
Model Deployment:

Saves the trained quantum model and scaler
Provides functionality to load and use the model in other applications
Can be integrated into websites or applications for real-time fraud detection
This project demonstrates how quantum computing can be applied to real-world financial problems, specifically in fraud detection, while comparing its performance with traditional machine learning approaches. It's particularly interesting because it uses quantum computing for a practical business application in the financial sector.


Data encoding (Feature Map) - converts classical data to quantum states
Variational circuit (PQC) - learns patterns in the quantum states
Measurement - converts quantum states back to classical predictions
Optimization (COBYLA) - iteratively improves the circuit parameters
